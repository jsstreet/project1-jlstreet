		<p>
			I am currently a computer engineering student at Texas A&M with a strong interest in building systems that connect software and hardware and intend to continue this passion in a professional setting. I enjoy working in collaborative environments and believe the strongest engineering solutions are developed from clear communication, shared problem-solving, and diverse perspectives. While I am particularly interested in exploring the electrical side of my degree, I have gained hands-on experience through coursework and projects involving circuit analysis, digital logic, and programming. In the remaining portion of my degree I needed to pursue front end web design, database management, and circuit design/implementation. I expand my engineering skill by dedicating time to learn through building, refining designs, and contributing thoughtfully to a team, and I am excited to continue developing technical skills that translate to real-world engineering applications.
